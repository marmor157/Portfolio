            I'm Mariusz Morawski Junior Frontend Developer. Student of Tadeusz
            Ko≈õciuszko University of Technology currently on a second year. I
            started my jurney with programming 6 years ago. Along the way I
            learned basics of C++, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The last one
            attracted me the most and holds me till this day. Today I program
            using ES6 and React. I also love tinkering with electronics
            alongside with some programming.
